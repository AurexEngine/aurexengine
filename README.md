## 🧠 What is AurexEngine?

**AurexEngine** is a lightweight, modular runtime engine for PHP.

It provides the foundational architecture required to power modern frameworks — without enforcing structure, opinions, or bundled features.

It is designed to:

- Power frameworks like **Modura** *(Coming Soon)*
- Enable developers to build their own framework layer
- Maintain long-term engine stability
- Minimize upgrade friction

AurexEngine focuses on the runtime lifecycle — not the application layer.

## ⚙️ Core Principles

- **Engine First** – Runtime separated from framework structure  
- **Minimal by Design** – Only essential components  
- **Composable Architecture** – Everything can be extended  
- **Long-Term Stability** – Core evolves carefully  
- **Framework Agnostic** – No enforced conventions  

---

## 🏗 Architecture Model

AurexEngine separates the engine from the framework layer.

This separation ensures:

- Engine stability
- Independent framework evolution
- Cleaner upgrades
- Predictable runtime behavior
